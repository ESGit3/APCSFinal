## Updates:

**May 22-23:** initialized the minesweeper project, and made it possible to display a grid of tiles of whatever size.
Goals to achieve by next commit: When tile is right clicked, a flag is placed

**May 28: ** many bugs:
able to detect tile click, but only in top left quadrant
flagging disappears right after click
possibly bc display is constantly looping, and ends up removing flags
flags do not show up in the right places
