# Final Project: Timed Minesweeper
3DSweeper by Ethan Shan

A 3 Dimensional Minesweeper. Minesweeper is a game where you locate and flag 
“Mines” based on tiles that indicate how many adjacent tiles contain mines. The game is won when the player has flagged all the mines, and is lost if the player uncovers a mine. In regular Minesweeper, there is a single 2D grid, with all mines on one level. In 3DSweeper, there are multiple layers to interact with, with mines varying from layer to layer, creating a type of minesweeper that requires more interactivity than before.

## Updates:

**May 22-23:** initialized the minesweeper project, and made it possible to display a grid of tiles of whatever size.
Goals to achieve by next commit: When tile is right clicked, a flag is placed
